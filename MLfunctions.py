# Design neural network to determine if given sentence is in English. I need to figure out a way to
# allow different sized strings for input into the neural network.
# Possible outline
# (1) Create an indicator function which takes in a string and a letter and outputs a distribution of that letter
#     within the string.
# (2) Create a function which takes in two distributions and returns a vector which contains information about
#     average distance between occurrences of the letters...
# (3) Write a program that determines average number of occurrences of each letter, and every 2, 3, and 4 letter combo
#     as we input sentences and keeps track of standard deviations for each.
# (4) Train this on many sentences.
# (5) Determine a method of making predictions.  (Steps (4) and (5) seem like I should
